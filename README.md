# Hey, I'm Julian

Builder. 20+ years shipping products. Currently founding [Deeplead.io](https://deeplead.io).

I started programming at 16 when I built [Grauezelle](https://jw.hn/projects), a riddle site that hit 200K daily visitors. Since then I've scaled companies from $32K to $4M in revenue, led marketing teams with seven-figure budgets, and spent the last few years going deep on AI-native software development.

## What I'm focused on

- **Building Deeplead** — my current company
- **AI-native development** — writing and thinking about how software engineering changes when AI agents do the mechanical work and humans focus on architecture, verification, and intent
- **The Dark Software Fabric** — a 7-layer verification system I use to let AI agents ship code autonomously with confidence

I write about this at [jw.hn](https://jw.hn).

## Open source

- **[wt](https://github.com/JWPapi/wt)** — Git worktree manager with deterministic dev server ports
- **[trigger-cli](https://github.com/JWPapi/trigger-cli)** — CLI tool for Trigger.dev: list, search, and run tasks from your terminal

## Stack

Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Trigger.dev, Vercel, MongoDB, Vitest, Playwright. I prefer boring, mainstream tech — it compounds better and AI tools understand it.
