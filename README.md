# 👋 Hey, I’m Julian Wagner

I build **scalable SaaS apps** with **Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Tailwind, and Vercel** — fast, clean, and production-ready.  
I care about performance, maintainability, and shipping features that actually matter.

### 🧠 Philosophy
> “Scalable systems come from simple, predictable code — not frameworks.”

I like:
- End-to-end type safety  
- Predictable async flows  
- Developer ergonomics that scale with the product
